# algorithms
This repo is aimed at me for understanding algorithms.

Contains:
1. Jupyter Notebook with Big O visualization.
2. `searches.py` with simple and binary search implementation.
3. `sorting.py` with selection sort algorithm.
4. `test_searches.py` and `test_sorting.py` with unittests.
5. `timer_context_manager.py` developed just for fun and 
practice.
